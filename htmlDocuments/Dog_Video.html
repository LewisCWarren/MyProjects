		         The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose “Renaissance hound” whose hallmark is the ridge, 
				 or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back. 
				 Though the breed was made famous in its native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying – but never,
				 ever killing – lions, today Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must
				 be prepared to deal with their independence and strong prey drive.
